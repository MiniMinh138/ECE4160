      <h2 class="text-center mt-0">Lab 03: Time of Flight (ToF) Sensors</h2>
      <hr class="divider" />
      <div class="text-body">
        <div class="Objective">
          <h3 class="h3 mb-2">Objective</h3>
          <p class="text-muted mb-0">The purpose of this lab was to setup the two ToF sensors and test their
            reliability. This lab also introduced us to basic soldering.
          </p>
          <hr class="divider divider-light" />
          <h3 class="h3 mb-2">Prelab</h3>
          <p class="text-muted mb-0">We read the manual and datasheet for the ToF, which was the VL53L1X model. The 2
            ToF sensors have the same address, so to get around this, we will solder a shutdown pin on one of the
            sensors to change it's address on boot up. We must also think about where to place the ToF sensors to avoid
            missing obstacles. We will place the sensors at the front and back of the robot. We would miss obstacles on
            the side of the robot and obstacles out of the field of view (i.e objects too close to the robot such as
            next to the wheel). This means we could also pick a configuration with 1 sensor at the front and 1 on the
            side, depending on our needs.
          </p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3 class="h3 mb-2">Soldering the Battery and Sensors</h3>
          <p class="text-muted mb-0">We want the Artemis Board to run separately from the laptop, so we need to attach a
            battery. We will use the battery that came with the RC car and change the connector to fit into the Artemis
            board.
          </p>
          <img src="assets/Lab3/battery.JPG" alt="Battery" width=80%>
          <p class="text-muted mb-0">Next, we need to solder QWIIC cables to the sensors. The QWIIC connector has 4
            cables which correspond to power/VIn (red), GND (black), SDA (blue), and SCL (yellow). We solder these wires
            to the corresponding ports on the sensor board. For 1 of the sensor boards, we also solder a wire to the
            XSHUT pin and connect that to one of the GPIO pins on the Artemis (pin 8 in this case).
          </p>
          <img src="assets/Lab3/tof.JPG" alt="ToF" width="80%">
          <h3 class="h3 mb-2">Setting up I2C</h3>
          <p class="text-muted mb-0">We use the "Example1_wire_I2C" file to test the I2C connection between our board
            and the sensor. It prints out the address of the ToF (only 1 at this point) sensor. The address was found to
            be 0x29 for both ToF sensors.</p>
          <img src="assets/Lab3/address.png" alt="ToF address">
          <h3 class="h3 mb-2">Gathering Data</h3>
          <p class="text-muted mb-0">The ToF sensors have 2 distance settings, for short(1.3m) and long(4m)
            distances. We will test the short distance setting. We set up an experiment where we gather average
            readings from the sensor from a distance of 0 meters to 1.5m in increments of 100mm.
          </p>
          <img src="assets/Lab3/calibrate.png" alt="ToF Calibration">
          <br>
          <p class="text-muted mb-0">We see that the sensor is relatively accurate, even past the recommended distance.
            The distance measurements above are averages. There was only a +/- 1mm discrepenacy below 1000mm, and the
            +/- 2-3mm above that.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h3 class="h3 mb-2">Running both Sensors</h3>
          <p class="text-muted mb-0">When both sensors are connected, they have the same address, so we must change
            their addresses. We will utilize the shutdown pin on one of the sensors. When we initialize, we will
            shutdown one sensor, send a command the change the address of the "on" sensor, and then turn the "off"
            sensor back on. This must be done each time the system powers on because the sensor addresses reset when
            powered off. This was done with this code:</p>
          <br>
          <p><code>
            digitalWrite(SHUTDOWN_PIN, LOW);
            <br>
            int resetAddr = distanceSensor2.getI2CAddress();
            <br>
            if (resetAddr == DEFAULT_ADDR){
              <br>
              distanceSensor2.setI2CAddress(NEW_ADDR);
              <br>
              Serial.print("Sensor 2 address changed to 0x");
              <br>
              Serial.println(distanceSensor2.getI2CAddress(), HEX);
              <br>
            }
            <br>
            delay(1000);
            <br>
            digitalWrite(SHUTDOWN_PIN, HIGH);</code></p>
          <img src="assets/Lab3/two_sensors.png" alt="Parallel Sensor Data" width=80%>
          <br>
          <h3 class="h3 mb-2">System Clock Speed</h3>
          <p class="text-muted mb-0">Now, we need to test the speed of the sensor vs. the Artemis clock. We ran this
            code to print out data at every cycle of the Artemis, and based on the results, we see the same sensor data
            is repeatedly printed. This suggests that new data is not being collected, which means the sensor is slower
            than the Artemis.</p>
