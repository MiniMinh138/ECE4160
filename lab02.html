      <h2 class="text-center mt-0">Lab 02: IMU</h2>
      <hr class="divider" />
      <div class="text-body">
        <div class="Objective">
          <h3 class="h3 mb-2">Objective</h3>
          <p class="text-muted mb-0">The purpose of this lab was to setup the IMU on the Artemis board and process the
            sensor data.
          </p>
          <hr class="divider divider-light" />
          <h4 class="h4 mb-2">Set up the IMU</h4>
          <p class="text-muted mb-0">The setup involved installing the library, connecting the IMU to the board using
            the QWIIC connector, and running the test code. We had to set the AD0_VAL to 0 because "ADDR+1" jumper on
            the IMU is shorted (closed).
          </p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h4 class="h4 mb-2">Accelerometer</h4>
          <p class="text-muted mb-0">The Accelerometer was used to estimate the roll and pitch of the board. In general,
            it was pretty accurate, but it was a little noisy. We ran a Fast Fourier Transformation analysis to see if
            we should add additional filtering.
          </p>
          <img src="assets/Lab2/Raw_Roll_A.png" alt="Raw_Roll_A">
          <img src="assets/Lab2/Raw_Pitch_A.png" alt="Raw_Pitch_A">
          <p class="text-muted mb-0">As we can see from the above pictures, it was pretty noisy data. There was a bit of
            skew with the sensor data, so we had to adjust them according to these equations:
            <br>
            <code>roll_a = 1.017*roll_a + 2.23;<br>
                  pitch_a = 1.016*pitch_a -1.22264;</code>
            <br>
            We then ran the
            data through a Fourier Transform function.
          </p>
          <img src="assets/Lab2/Roll_A_FFT.png" alt="Roll_FFT">
          <img src="assets/Lab2/Pitch_A_FFT.png" alt="Pitch_FFT">
          <p class="text-muted mb-0">As we can see from the above pictures, we see there are large spikes near ~140Hz.
            Unfortunately, when calculating the alpha for the low pass filter, this gives a value of 0.9999 which is
            essentially no filtering. We do see there is a general flatness to the FFT graph. This is due to the
            internal low pass filter built into the board.
          </p>
          <img src="assets/Lab2/alpha.png" alt="LowPass Calculation">
          <p class="text-muted mb-0">We then attempted the noisy data by tapping the table, but the FFT graph yielded
            similar results.</p>
          <br>
          <h4 class="h4 mb-2">Gyroscope</h4>
          <p class="text-muted mb-0">The Gyroscope was used to estimate the roll, pitch, and yaw of the board. The data
            readings had very little noise, but were very susceptible to drift. We compare the gyroscope data to the
            accelerometer and then fuse the two using a complimentary filter to have more accurate readings.</p>
          <img src="assets/Lab2/Raw_Gyro.png" alt="Raw_Gyro">
          <img src="assets/Lab2/Drift_Pitch.png" alt="Drift_Pitch">
          <img src="assets/Lab2/Drift_Roll.png" alt="Drift_Roll">
          <img src="assets/Lab2/Drift_Yaw.png" alt="Drift_Yaw">
          <p class="text-muted mb-0">We see that the data has lttle noise, but the drift is quite large from the pitch
            and yaw. A noteworthy point is that the scales of the gyroscope derived angles differ from the
            accelerometer. This is rectified with the complimentary filter.
          </p>
          <img src="assets/Lab2/Pitch_Comp.png" alt="Pitch_Comp">
          <img src="assets/Lab2/Roll_Comp.png" alt="Roll_Comp">
          <p class="text-muted mb-0">We see from the graphs that the complimentary filter (with 0.9 lending towards the
            gyroscope and 0.1 towards the accelerometer), does drastically decrease the drifting.</p>
          <br>
          <h5 class="h5 mb-2">Sample Data</h5>
          <p class="text-muted mb-0">Throughout the data exploration, we had the data sampled regardless of when it was
            ready. This had a sample rate of ~260Hz, but there was a lot of redudant data. We then move this code into
            the same if statement that checks if the new data was ready. This increased the number of unique data
            values, but decreased our sampling rate to ~150Hz. Regardless, with an array size of 5000, we were able to
            collect over 30 seconds of data, which is more than enough.

          <h5 class="h5 mb-2">Record Stunt</h5>
          <p class="text-muted mb-0">This portion of the lab has been removed as the board has not been mounted yet. I
            did test the RC robot to ensure the batteries worked and the robot would drive.</p>
